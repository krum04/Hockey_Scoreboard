# Hockey_Scoreboard

This project originally started based on an Arduino Nano. The current setup of the scoreboard is an Arduino Nano and and two arrays of NeoPixels wired in series for each score.

I am transitioning the controller to a WeMos D1 Mini running Micropython. I plan to add a simple web app to allow the user to control from their phone, along with large physical arcade buttons.
